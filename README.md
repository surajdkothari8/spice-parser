# spice-parser
This project reads the spice decks for a_characterization cells and produces a fixed format for post process analyses. 
This parser consists of a Perl script that inputs the raw files based on various temperature parameters and displays outputs as specific files based on users commands to get voltage or current or any electrical parameter present in the Characterization spice deck.
